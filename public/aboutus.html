    <p>C-DAC's Education and Training programmes are aimed at creating skilled
         manpower in the country by providing quality training programmes in the
        field of Electronics and ICT. This activity started almost two decades
        ago with a humble beginning of training about 20 students per year, but 
        has today grown to an extent of training more than 5000 students per year.
         It also grew from just one training centre to about 50 training centres 
         across India and has even made its presence in several countries abroad. 
         In addition to conducting wide range of training programmes in the areas 
         of Information, Communication and Electronics technologies, C-DAC also 
         develops ICT tools and technologies for modern methods of imparting 
         education and training to masses. The Education and Training activities 
         of C-DAC are governed and steered by Academic Council (AC) and Academic Management Committee (AMC)</p>
